# Dynamical-Tidal-Response-of-Polytropic-Stars

This repository contains a code to analyze the dynamical tidal response of polytropic stars in general relativity.
The code is based on the paper:

## Description of the Mathematica Notebooks

The repository contains a number of Mathematica notebooks.

The notebook supplementary_funcs.nb contains the expressions for the supplementary functions defined in the paper.

The notebook generate-normalized-solution.nb generates the normalized solutions $\hat{N} H_{P/Q,\ell}$ used in the paper for a given value of $\ell$.

## Description of C++ Code
The C++ code provided in the folder Polytropic-EoS can be used to study the dynamical tidal response of a polytropic star in full general relativity.
To install the code you need to install the C++ package brew and download the eigen-3.4.0 package from $\href{here}{https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page}$
