# Dynamical-Tidal-Response-of-Polytropic-Stars

This repository contains a code to analyze the dynamical tidal response of polytropic stars in general relativity.
The code is based on the paper:

## Description of the Mathematica Notebooks

The repository contains a number of Mathematica notebooks.

The notebook supplementary_funcs.nb contains the expressions for the supplementary functions defined in the paper.

The notebook generate-normalized-solution.nb generates the normalized solutions $\hat{N} H_{P/Q,\ell}$ used in the paper for a given value of $\ell$.
